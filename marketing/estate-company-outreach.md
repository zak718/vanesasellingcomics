## Email Outreach Template

**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity - Comic Book Collections

---

Hi [Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out because I specialize in buying comic book collections, and I think there could be a great partnership opportunity between us.

**The Challenge:**
When you're handling an estate, you likely encounter comic books from time to time. They can be tricky to value, take up space, and may not fit your typical sale format. Many estate professionals end up selling them for pennies on the dollar or including them in "lot" sales.

**My Solution:**
I'm a professional comic book buyer serving NY, NJ, PA, and MD. I:
- Come on-site to assess collections
- Provide fair, market-based offers
- Handle all the heavy lifting
- Pay immediately (cash or check)
- Have 99.9% positive feedback from 2,900+ transactions

**Partnership Offer:**
I'd like to offer a **10% referral fee** for any collection I purchase through your referral. For a typical collection worth $500-2000, that's $50-200 for a simple phone call.

**How It Works:**
1. You encounter comics at an estate
2. You give me a call or text a few photos
3. I provide a quick estimate
4. If the family accepts, I handle the rest
5. You receive your referral fee within 7 days

This lets you focus on your core business while ensuring the family gets fair value for the comics.

Would you be open to a quick call to discuss? I'm also happy to provide references from other estate professionals I work with.

Best regards,

Tony

## Phone Script

"Hi, my name is Tony. I'm a professional comic book buyer in the [area], and I'm reaching out to estate sale companies about a potential partnership.

When you handle estates, do you ever run into comic book collections?

*[If yes]*

Great! I'd love to work with you on those. I come on-site, assess the collection, make a fair offer, and pay cash. I also offer a 10% referral fee for any collection I purchase through your referral.

Would you be open to keeping my card on hand for when that situation comes up?

No problem at all. If one does come up in the future, I'm the guy to call. Can I send you my contact info?"
